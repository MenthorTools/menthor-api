## 1. What is Menthor API?

Menthor API is our 2.0 infrastructure of the Menthor Editor (which is not yet attached to it). Its goal is to give you access to all Menthor Editor's capabilities dynamically via code. So far, that includes OntoUML modeling with the addition of events, powertypes and qualities, syntactical checking, content importation from the EA tool and support for both UML and OLED. Future work will include all Menthor's remaining features such as codification to OWL/RDF, the Alloy generation, SBVR generation, semantic anti-patterns and so on.
