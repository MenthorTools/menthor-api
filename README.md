## 1. What is Menthor API?

Menthor API is a ongoing project that aims to develop a new programming infrastructure to the Menthor Editor (the API is not attached to the editor yet). Its goal is to give you access to all Menthor Editor's capabilities dynamically via code. So far, that includes OntoUML modeling with the addition of events, powertypes and qualities, syntactical checking, content importation from the Sparx Systems' EA tool and support for both UML and OLED (the precursor of the Menthor Editor). Ongoing work include all Menthor's remaining features such as codification to OWL/RDF, the Alloy generation, SBVR generation, and semantic anti-patterns.

## 2. License

The API is currently distributed under MIT license.

## 3. Source Code

In order to run the API with the source code, you need the following tools:
* Java 7 or superior
* IntelliJ with GROOVY installed
* Git Client application (GitHub, Tortoise, Source Tree, etc)
